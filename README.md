## Hi there 👋

# About Me

Hi, I’m Tobechukwu. I’m passionate about problem-solving, always seeking the most efficient and elegant solutions rather than just any solution. I’m fascinated by AI development and exploring ways it can be leveraged to make the world a better place.

I love digging into systems at a low level to understand how they work internally and learning deeply enough that I can teach others, because teaching strengthens my own understanding. Sharing knowledge and helping people drives my work, and I aim to combine curiosity, technical skill, and empathy in everything I do.

# My Philosophy

- I’m a firm believer in the Feynman Technique: to truly understand a concept, you should be able to explain it to someone with little prior knowledge. I use analogies and clear comments in my code so it’s understandable at first glance.

- I enjoy going under the hood of systems, exploring how components communicate when I’m writing code, and uncovering the mechanics behind the scenes.

- I focus on real-world problems, looking for areas that make people uncomfortable and trying to understand why. By understanding the root of a problem, I can design solutions that actually make a difference.

- I’m a lifelong learner, often diving into topics beyond programming, including biology and chemistry, because cross-disciplinary knowledge often reveals innovative solutions. My ultimate goal is to improve the standard of living through thoughtful problem-solving.
